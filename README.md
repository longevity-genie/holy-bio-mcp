## üéØ Our Mission

Holy Bio MCP is a unified framework born during Bio x AI Hackathon-2025 from our practical experience building LLM-powered agents at the **Longevity Genie project**, **IBIMA (Institute for Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research)**, and the **Systems Biology of Aging Group**. Our goal is to make life easier for researchers by providing a suite of specialized, interoperable tools that seamlessly integrate into AI-driven IDEs (like Cursor, Windsurf), chat clients (like Anthropic's Claude Desktop), and serve as foundational building blocks for complex agentic workflows (using  ElizaOS, Just-Agents, AutoGen, etc.).

This project aggregates several powerful, standalone MCP servers into a single, cohesive ecosystem for advanced bioinformatics and longevity research.

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

MCP is a protocol designed to bridge the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialized, domain-specific tools and databases. It provides a standardized way for AI assistants and agents to access complex functionalities through structured, type-safe interfaces.

If you want to understand MCP in more detail and learn how to use it effectively, we recommend these resources:

- **DeepLearning.AI Course**: [MCP: Build Rich-Context AI Apps](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/mcp-build-rich-context-ai-apps-with-anthropic/)
- **Official Documentation**: [Model Context Protocol Website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
- **Community**: Search for "Model Context Protocol" on YouTube and other platforms for tutorials and discussions.

## üî¨ Real-World Example in Action

Here's a real conversation (that you can easily reproduce yourself as all MCP-es are working and covered with tests) showing Holy Bio MCP servers working together to answer complex research questions, demonstrating the power of this integrated approach:

- **[pharmacology-mcp](https://github.com/antonkulaga/pharmacology-mcp)**: Access to the Guide to PHARMACOLOGY database for drug, target, and ligand information.

## Server Capabilities & Example Questions

Instead of just listing functions, here's a look at the kind of research questions you can answer with each server.

## üöÄ Getting Started: Unified Configuration

This repository provides unified configuration files that enable all the included servers at once. Here's how to get started:

### Option 1: Automatic Setup with STDIO (Recommended)

This is the simplest and most efficient way to use the framework. Your MCP client will do all the work.

1.  **Prerequisite**: Make sure you have `uv` installed. If not, it's a one-line command:
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
2.  **Configure Your Client**: Point your MCP-compatible client (e.g., Cursor, Claude Desktop) to use the `mcp-config-stdio.json` file from this repository.

**That's it!** You do not need to run any `uvx` commands manually. Your MCP client will automatically use `uvx` to launch the necessary servers in the background when a tool is called and manage them for you.

### Option 2: Manual Setup with HTTP

This method is for advanced users who prefer to run each server as a persistent, long-running process.

1.  **Prerequisite**: Install `uv` as shown above.
2.  **Start Servers Manually**: For each server you want to use, open a separate terminal and run its `uvx` command with the `server` argument. The `mcp-config-http.json` file lists the required command and port for each server. For example:
    ```bash
    # Terminal 1
    uvx biothings-mcp server --port 3001

    # Terminal 2
    uvx gget-mcp server --port 3002
    
    # ...and so on for other servers.
    ```
3.  **Configure Your Client**: Point your MCP client to use the `mcp-config-http.json` file.
