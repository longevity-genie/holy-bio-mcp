__Developed during [Bio x AI Hackathon 2025](https://bio-x-ai-berlin.devfolio.co/overview)__

## üéØ Our Mission

Holy Bio MCP is a unified framework born during Bio x AI Hackathon-2025 from our practical experience building LLM-powered agents at the **Longevity Genie project**, **IBIMA (Institute for Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research)**, and the **Systems Biology of Aging Group**. Our goal is to make life easier for researchers by providing a suite of specialized, interoperable tools that seamlessly integrate into AI-driven IDEs (like Cursor, Windsurf), chat clients (like Anthropic's Claude Desktop), and serve as foundational building blocks for complex agentic workflows (using  ElizaOS, Just-Agents, AutoGen, etc.).

This project aggregates several powerful, standalone MCP servers into a single, cohesive ecosystem for advanced bioinformatics and longevity research, **including a native ElizaOS plugin** for building autonomous research agents.

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

MCP is a protocol designed to bridge the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialized, domain-specific tools and databases. It provides a standardized way for AI assistants and agents to access complex functionalities through structured, type-safe interfaces.

If you want to understand MCP in more detail and learn how to use it effectively, we recommend these resources:

- **DeepLearning.AI Course**: [MCP: Build Rich-Context AI Apps](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/mcp-build-rich-context-ai-apps-with-anthropic/)
- **Official Documentation**: [Model Context Protocol Website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
- **Community**: Search for "Model Context Protocol" on YouTube and other platforms for tutorials and discussions.

## üî¨ Real-World Example in Action

Here's a real conversation (that you can easily reproduce yourself as all MCP-es are working and covered with tests) showing Holy Bio MCP servers working together to answer complex research questions, demonstrating the power of this integrated approach:

## üöÄ Getting Started: Unified Configuration

This repository provides unified configuration files that enable all the included servers at once. Here's how to get started:

### Option 1: Copy-Paste Configuration (Quickest Start)

For immediate use without cloning this repository, copy and paste this configuration directly into your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "biothings-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "biothings-mcp", "stdio"]
    },
    "gget-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["gget-mcp", "stdio"]
    },
    "synergy-age-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["synergy-age-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    },
    "opengenes-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["opengenes-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    },
    "pharmacology-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "pharmacology-mcp", "stdio"]
    }
  }
} 
```

### Option 2: Automatic Setup with STDIO (Using Repository Files)

This method uses the configuration files from this repository.

1.  **Prerequisite**: Make sure you have `uv` installed. If not, it's a one-line command:
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
2.  **Configure Your Client**: Point your MCP-compatible client (e.g., Cursor, Claude Desktop) to use the `mcp-config-stdio.json` file from this repository.

**That's it!** You do not need to run any `uvx` commands manually. Your MCP client will automatically use `uvx` to launch the necessary servers in the background when a tool is called and manage them for you.

### Configuration Video Tutorial

For a visual guide on setting up clients like Cursor with these configuration files, watch our **[Configuration Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0sHWGJvE0)**.

## ü§ñ Integration Scenarios

- **Interactive Research (Chat-based)**: Use with AI assistants like Claude for exploratory research.
- **AI-Enhanced Development (IDE Integration)**: Integrate with Cursor or Windsurf to access biomedical data and generate analysis scripts while coding.
- **Agentic Workflows (Automated Research)**: Build autonomous research agents using frameworks like AutoGen or - **ElizaOS with our biostratum plugin** for seamless multi-server integration.

### ElizaOS Integration with Biostratum Plugin

Our **biostratum-eliza** plugin provides native ElizaOS integration, allowing you to create sophisticated AI agents that can:

- **Automatically connect** to all Holy Bio MCP servers simultaneously
- **Intelligently route** research queries to the most appropriate data sources
- **Combine insights** from multiple biological databases in a single conversation
- **Execute complex workflows** like finding longevity genes, analyzing their variants, and identifying drug targets

**Quick Start with ElizaOS:**
```bash
# Install the plugin
elizaos plugins add @longevity-genie/biostratum-mcp-plugin

# Start your bio-research agent
elizaos agent start --path bio-gagarin.json
```

The plugin supports simplified configuration for all biostratum servers:
```json
{
  "name": "Bio Research Agent",
  "plugins": ["@longevity-genie/biostratum-mcp-plugin"],
  "settings": {
    "biostratum": {
      "biothings": {},
      "opengenes": {},
      "gget": {},
      "pharmacology": {},
      "synergy-age": {}
    }
