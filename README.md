## üéØ Our Mission

Holy Bio MCP is a unified framework born during Bio x AI Hackathon-2025 from our practical experience building LLM-powered agents at the **Longevity Genie project**, **IBIMA (Institute for Biostatistics and Informatics in Medicine and Ageing Research)**, and the **Systems Biology of Aging Group**. Our goal is to make life easier for researchers by providing a suite of specialized, interoperable tools that seamlessly integrate into AI-driven IDEs (like Cursor, Windsurf), chat clients (like Anthropic's Claude Desktop), and serve as foundational building blocks for complex agentic workflows (using  ElizaOS, Just-Agents, AutoGen, etc.).

This project aggregates several powerful, standalone MCP servers into a single, cohesive ecosystem for advanced bioinformatics and longevity research.

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

MCP is a protocol designed to bridge the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialized, domain-specific tools and databases. It provides a standardized way for AI assistants and agents to access complex functionalities through structured, type-safe interfaces.

If you want to understand MCP in more detail and learn how to use it effectively, we recommend these resources:

- **DeepLearning.AI Course**: [MCP: Build Rich-Context AI Apps](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/mcp-build-rich-context-ai-apps-with-anthropic/)
- **Official Documentation**: [Model Context Protocol Website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
- **Community**: Search for "Model Context Protocol" on YouTube and other platforms for tutorials and discussions.

## üî¨ Real-World Example in Action

Here's a real conversation (that you can easily reproduce yourself as all MCP-es are working and covered with tests) showing Holy Bio MCP servers working together to answer complex research questions, demonstrating the power of this integrated approach:

## üõ†Ô∏è Included MCP Servers

This framework unites the following specialized MCP servers. Each is a powerful tool on its own, but together they form a comprehensive research platform.

- **[biothings-mcp](https://github.com/longevity-genie/biothings-mcp)**: Access to BioThings.io APIs for comprehensive gene, variant, chemical, and taxonomic data.
- **[gget-mcp](https://github.com/longevity-genie/gget-mcp)**: A powerful bioinformatics toolkit for genomics queries and analysis, wrapping the popular `gget` library.
- **[opengenes-mcp](https://github.com/longevity-genie/opengenes-mcp)**: A queryable database for aging and longevity research from the OpenGenes project.
- **[synergy-age-mcp](https://github.com/longevity-genie/synergy-age-mcp)**: A database of synergistic and antagonistic genetic interactions in longevity from SynergyAge.
- **[pharmacology-mcp](https://github.com/antonkulaga/pharmacology-mcp)**: Access to the Guide to PHARMACOLOGY database for drug, target, and ligand information.

## Server Capabilities & Example Questions

Instead of just listing functions, here's a look at the kind of research questions you can answer with each server.

### 1. üß¨ `biothings-mcp`

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/longevity-genie/biothings-mcp/raw/main/images/cursor_usage_example.jpg" alt="biothings-mcp usage example"/></div>

Wraps the BioThings.io APIs to provide foundational biological data.

**Example Research Questions:**
- "What are the functions and pathways associated with the human gene *BRAF*?"
- "Find all variants in the *EGFR* gene and provide their clinical significance from ClinVar."
- "What is the molecular formula and structure of the compound 'aspirin'?"
- "Download the protein FASTA sequence for UniProt ID P04637."
- "What is the taxonomic lineage for *Mus musculus*?"

### 2. üî¨ `gget-mcp`

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/longevity-genie/gget-mcp/raw/main/images/screenshot_example.png" alt="gget-mcp usage example"/></div>

Provides a rich set of tools for sequence analysis, functional genomics, and structural biology.

**Example Research Questions:**
- "Find information about the human *TP53* gene and get its protein sequence."
- "Perform enrichment analysis for a set of cancer-related genes: *TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2*."
- "Get the 3D structure information for the protein encoded by the *EGFR* gene from AlphaFold."
- "Find mutations in the COSMIC database for the *PIK3CA* gene."
- "Perform a BLAST search with the DNA sequence 'ATGGCGCCCGAACAGGGAC' to identify its origin."
- "Align multiple protein sequences to find conserved regions."

### 3. üï∞Ô∏è `opengenes-mcp`

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/longevity-genie/opengenes-mcp/raw/main/images/open-genes-usage-chat.png" alt="opengenes-mcp usage example"/></div>

A queryable SQL database focused on the genetics of aging and longevity.

**Example Research Questions:**
- "Which genetic interventions extended the lifespan of mice the most?"
- "What polymorphisms in *FOXO3* are associated with human longevity?"
- "Which hallmarks of aging are associated with the *KL* (Klotho) gene?"
- "Are there any liver-specific interventions that increase lifespan in mice?"
- "Find genes that are associated with both longevity in human studies and have lifespan-extending effects in model organisms."

### 4. üîÑ `synergy-age-mcp`

<div align="center"><img src="https://www.synergyage.info/static/curation/images/SynergyAgeFigs3.4.png" alt="synergy-age-mcp interaction types"/></div>

A specialized SQL database for synergistic, antagonistic, and additive genetic interactions in longevity.

**Example Research Questions:**
- "Which genetic interventions show the strongest synergistic effects in *C. elegans*?"
- "What is the relationship between *daf-2* and *daf-16* mutations in C. elegans longevity?"

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Install `uv` (a modern Python package manager):

```bash
# Download and install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Running Individual Servers

Each MCP server can be run independently using `uvx`, which will automatically handle installation.

```bash
# BioThings API access
uvx biothings-mcp

# Bioinformatics toolkit
uvx gget-mcp

# Aging research database  
uvx opengenes-mcp

# Synergistic interventions
uvx synergy-age-mcp

# Pharmacology database
uvx pharmacology-mcp
```

Each server can be run in different modes (`stdio`, `server`, `sse`) for compatibility with various MCP clients.

## üîß Configuring AI Clients

Simply point your MCP-compatible AI client to the appropriate configuration file from the respective server's repository (e.g., `mcp-config-stdio.json`).

For a visual guide on setting up clients like Cursor, watch our **[Configuration Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0sHWGJvE0)**. The principles shown apply to all servers in this framework.

## ü§ñ Integration Scenarios

- **Interactive Research (Chat-based)**: Use with AI assistants like Claude for exploratory research.
- **AI-Enhanced Development (IDE Integration)**: Integrate with Cursor or Windsurf to access biomedical data and generate analysis scripts while coding.
- **Agentic Workflows (Automated Research)**: Build autonomous research agents using frameworks like AutoGen or ElizaOS.
